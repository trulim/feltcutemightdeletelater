    <h1>The Expanse</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        The best sci-fi series you haven't watched (or read). While commonly
        referred to as one of the best sci-fi shows by sci-fi aficionados, it
        never got the mainstream success that it deserved. Additionally, it got
        canceled. Twice.

        The Expanse is based on a science fiction book series of the same title
        by authors Daniel Abraham and Ty Frank, who write under the pen name
        James S. A. Corey. The duo began collaborating in 2011 when Ty Frank was
        working as a personal assistant for George R. R. Martin. They are also
        executive producers on the show. The book series spans nine books,
        though only the first six books have been adapted into the show so far.

        Without giving too much away, the plot of the expanse is set in the
        future, a few hundred years from now, where humans have colonized the
        Solar System. A group of people gets caught up in the conflict between
        Earth, Mars and The Belt. This show has everything: politics,
        colonization, issues of class, representation and exploitation,
        conflicts, wars, real dangers and consequences of living in space,
        believable characters, detective noir mystery, great cinematography,
        scientific realism, drama, love, revenge, suspense and of course,
        aliens.

        Going through Reddit posts, I must agree that you do have to sit through
        the first season in order to start seeing how good and engrossing this
        show is. I highly recommend reading the books too as they are
        fantastically written. I'm saying this as someone who rarely reads
        books, but finished them in one breath. Whether you read the books first
        or watch the show, I think it doesn't matter. You're still gonna
        appreciate how well this show is made with its complex realistic
        characters, attention to scientific authenticity, and stunning visuals.

        I want to be fully transparent: I wrote this text myself, but I used
        ChatGPT to check the grammar.
